		My name is morgan, 55 years old, In a moment of misplaced trust, my entire life savings (120,000 USD) was stolen.<br> I received a call from someone pretending to be his bank, armed with all his personal information.<br> They convinced him to confirm his card details, and within a single minute, everything I had worked for over the past years was gone, transferred to a stranger’s account.<br>

When I reached out to the bank for help, they refused, claiming it was his fault for answering the call.<br> He was left with nothing. After years of working abroad, sacrificing time with family and friends, now I find myself back at square one, emotionally devastated and financially ruined.<br>

This cruel situation has shattered my life and left me struggling to put my life back together. I’ve seen my own mental health get worse, and it breaks my heart to watch myself be torn apart by something so unfair.<br>

I can't work anymore; I am diabetic. and my heart has big trouble (mitral valve regurgitation).  and I can't do any operation, for I am diabetic. Yes, I am dying. But I have my daughters (15 and 8); they can't afford this life without me or someone to care for them.<br>

I’m starting this fundraiser because I believe in the power of community and kindness. I hope to raise enough for my daughters; now we just have 1 month, then I will lose our home. Also, I can't get food for my kids, and I hope to find someone, or that there are still people out there who care. Any contribution, no matter how small, will help my family rebuild and restore a glimmer of hope in a time of despair.<br>
I just have one way for this fundraising by Binance account, by USDT.<br><br>
PS. PayPal or Western Union. not easy to use in my country.<br><br><br>

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand this painful situation. Your support means the world to us.<br>

would deeply appreciate any contributions to help me achieve this goal. Thank you for your support!
